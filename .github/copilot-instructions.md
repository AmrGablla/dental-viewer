<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a Vue.js 3 application with TypeScript that provides a 3D dental viewer for STL files with teeth segmentation capabilities.

## Key Technologies
- Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development

## Architecture Guidelines
- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all 3D objects and data structures
- Follow Vue.js best practices for component composition
- Use Three.js efficiently with proper memory management
- Implement reactive state management for 3D scene updates

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use descriptive variable names for 3D objects and medical terminology
- Comment complex 3D mathematics and segmentation algorithms
