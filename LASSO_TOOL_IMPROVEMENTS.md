# Improved Lasso Tool for Tooth Segmentation

## Problem Solved

The original lasso tool had a significant issue: it would select surfaces **behind** the intended target, making precise tooth segmentation difficult. This occurred because the tool only performed 2D polygon-in-point tests without considering the 3D depth and visibility of vertices.

## Solution Overview

We've implemented **three new selection tools** that address this core issue:

### 1. Depth-Aware Lasso (`DepthAwareLassoService`)
- **Backface culling**: Filters out vertices facing away from the camera
- **Raycast occlusion testing**: Uses raycasting to determine if vertices are actually visible
- **Depth buffer awareness**: Considers the Z-depth of vertices to prevent selection behind surfaces
- **Multiple filtering layers**: Combines several techniques to ensure only visible, front-facing vertices are selected

### 2. Surface-Aware Brush (`SurfaceAwareBrushService`)
- **Continuous brush strokes**: Paint-style selection for more intuitive interaction
- **Surface distance filtering**: Only selects vertices on or near the primary intersected surface
- **Real-time visual feedback**: Shows brush cursor and selection preview
- **Adjustable brush size**: Configurable radius from 5-100 pixels

### 3. Enhanced Tool Switching
- **Smart tool selection**: Easily switch between different selection algorithms
- **Unified interface**: All tools share the same UI controls and modes
- **Settings panel**: Configure depth awareness, brush size, and surface filtering options

## Key Technical Improvements

### Core Issues Fixed:
1. **Selection behind surfaces** - Now only selects visible vertices
2. **Imprecise selection** - Multiple filtering layers ensure accuracy
3. **Poor user feedback** - Real-time selection info and visual previews
4. **Limited tool options** - Three different selection approaches for different use cases

### New Features:
- **Depth-aware selection**: Toggle between traditional and smart selection
- **Surface-only mode**: Exclude back-facing vertices from selection
- **Brush tool**: Alternative to lasso for continuous selection
- **Selection statistics**: Real-time vertex count and tool information
- **Visual improvements**: Better color coding and visual feedback

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Selection Tools
- Click the **Lasso (‚úèÔ∏è)** or **Brush (üñåÔ∏è)** mode buttons in the top toolbar
- The Selection Toolbar will appear with tool options

### 2. Choose Your Selection Tool
- **Smart Lasso (üéØ)**: Recommended for most use cases - depth-aware lasso selection
- **Enhanced Lasso (‚úèÔ∏è)**: Original enhanced lasso tool
- **Surface Brush (üñåÔ∏è)**: Paint-style selection for continuous strokes

### 3. Configure Settings
- **Depth Aware Selection**: Only select visible surfaces (recommended: ON)
- **Surface Only**: Exclude back-facing vertices (recommended: ON)
- **Brush Size**: Adjust brush radius for paint-style selection (5-100 pixels)

### 4. Create Segments
- **Create Mode**: Draw lasso/brush to create new segments
- **Select Mode**: Select existing segments
- **Add Mode**: Add vertices to selected segment
- **Remove Mode**: Remove vertices from selected segment

## Implementation Details

### Files Added/Modified:
- `src/services/DepthAwareLassoService.ts` - New depth-aware lasso implementation
- `src/services/SurfaceAwareBrushService.ts` - New brush selection tool
- `src/components/SelectionToolbar.vue` - New UI for tool selection and settings
- `src/components/TopToolbar.vue` - Updated to include new selection toolbar
- `src/components/DentalViewer.vue` - Integrated new selection services
- `src/types/dental.ts` - Added new types for selection tools
- `src/composables/useCameraControls.ts` - Added brush tool support

### Key Algorithms:
1. **Raycast-based occlusion testing**: Ensures vertices are not hidden behind other geometry
2. **Backface culling**: Uses surface normals to filter out vertices facing away
3. **Surface distance filtering**: For brush tool, only selects vertices on the primary surface
4. **Multi-layered selection**: Combines multiple filtering approaches for maximum accuracy

## Technical Benefits

1. **Precise Selection**: No more accidental selection of hidden surfaces
2. **Intuitive Tools**: Multiple selection methods for different workflows
3. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient algorithms with minimal performance impact
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear visual feedback and easy-to-understand controls
5. **Extensible**: Clean architecture allows for future tool additions

## Future Enhancements

- **3D brush**: Volumetric brush selection
- **Smart edge detection**: Automatic boundary detection for teeth
- **Selection history**: Undo/redo for selection operations
- **Batch operations**: Apply same selection to multiple models
- **Export selections**: Save/load selection patterns

## Migration Notes

- The original `EnhancedLassoService` is still available for backward compatibility
- Default tool is now the `DepthAwareLassoService` for better user experience
- All existing lasso functionality remains intact
- New tools are opt-in and can be toggled via the selection toolbar

This improvement significantly enhances the precision and usability of the tooth segmentation workflow, making it much easier to create accurate dental segments without selecting unwanted surfaces behind the target area.
