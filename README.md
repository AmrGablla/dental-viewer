## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

### Loading STL Files
1. Click "Load STL File" button
2. Select an STL file containing a dental model
3. The model will be automatically loaded and rendered

### Automatic Segmentation
1. After loading a model, choose a segmentation method:
   - **Curvature**: Segments based on surface curvature
   - **Concavity**: Detects concave regions (tooth boundaries)
   - **K-Means**: Clusters vertices by spatial proximity
   - **Region Growing**: Grows regions from seed points

2. Adjust parameters using the sliders
3. Click "Apply Segmentation" to update the segmentation

### Manual Refinement
1. Select an interaction mode:
   - **Select**: Click to select individual segments
   - **Lasso**: Draw a freehand selection area
   - **Brush**: Paint-style selection
   - **Move**: Translate selected segments
   - **Rotate**: Rotate selected segments

2. Use the segment list to:
   - Change colors
   - Merge segments
   - Split segments
   - Delete segments

### Exporting Results
1. Click "Export Model" to download segmentation data
2. The JSON file contains vertex data, colors, and metadata

## Segmentation Algorithms

### Curvature-Based Segmentation
Uses mean and Gaussian curvature to identify tooth boundaries. High curvature areas typically correspond to edges between teeth.

### Concavity Detection
Identifies concave regions where teeth meet the gums or adjacent teeth.

### K-Means Clustering
Spatially clusters vertices into a specified number of groups, useful for separating individual teeth.

### Region Growing
Starts from seed points and grows regions based on geometric similarity (normal vectors, curvature).

### DBSCAN Clustering
Density-based clustering that can handle irregular tooth shapes and automatically determine the number of clusters.

## Advanced Features

### Transform Gizmos
Interactive 3D handles for precise tooth movement and rotation with visual feedback.

### BVH Acceleration
Uses Bounding Volume Hierarchy for fast ray-mesh intersection testing, enabling smooth interaction with complex models.

### Multi-Selection Support
Select multiple teeth simultaneously for batch operations.

### Undo/Redo System
(Planned) Track changes for easy revision of segmentation decisions.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

Requires WebGL 2.0 support for optimal performance.

## Performance Considerations

- STL files up to 50MB are handled efficiently
- Large models (>100k vertices) may experience slower segmentation
- Consider using Web Workers for heavy computations (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements

### Backend Integration
For complex models, consider integrating with a Python backend using:
- **FastAPI** for REST API
- **Open3D** for advanced geometric processing
- **Trimesh** for mesh operations
- **NumPy/SciPy** for mathematical computations

### Machine Learning Integration
- Neural network-based tooth segmentation
- Automatic tooth numbering
- Pathology detection

### Additional File Formats
- PLY files
- OBJ files with materials
- DICOM integration for CT scans

1. Extend `SegmentationService.ts`
2. Add method to `SegmentationParams` type
