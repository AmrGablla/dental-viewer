# Enhanced Lasso Tool Features

The enhanced lasso tool provides advanced segmentation capabilities with multiple operation modes and improved user experience.

## Features Added

### 1. Multiple Lasso Modes

#### Create Mode (✨)
- **Purpose**: Create new segments from the original mesh
- **Usage**: Draw a lasso around vertices to create a new segment
- **Behavior**: Always works from the original mesh, allowing multiple segments to be created

#### Select Mode (◯)
- **Purpose**: Select multiple existing segments
- **Usage**: Draw a lasso around segments to select them all at once
- **Behavior**: Multi-select segments for bulk operations

#### Add Mode (➕)
- **Purpose**: Add vertices to existing segments
- **Usage**: Select a segment, then draw a lasso to add more vertices to it
- **Behavior**: Expands existing segments (requires implementation)

#### Subtract Mode (➖)
- **Purpose**: Remove vertices from existing segments
- **Usage**: Select a segment, then draw a lasso to remove vertices from it
- **Behavior**: Refines segment boundaries (requires implementation)

### 2. Visual Improvements

- **Mode-specific colors**: Different colors for different lasso modes
  - Green: Create mode
  - Blue: Add mode
  - Red: Subtract mode
  - Orange: Select mode

- **Different dash patterns**: Visual distinction between modes
- **Real-time preview**: See the selection area as you draw

### 3. Enhanced Controls

- **Preview mode**: Toggle preview before finalizing operations
- **Confirm/Cancel**: Review and approve selections before applying
- **Mode switching**: Quick switching between lasso modes in the toolbar

### 4. Better User Experience

- **Smart mode detection**: Automatically disable unavailable modes
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indication of current mode and available actions
- **Improved tooltips**: Better descriptions of each mode's functionality

## Usage Instructions

1. **Load an STL file** using the "Load STL" button
2. **Select the lasso tool** from the interaction modes
3. **Choose a lasso mode**:
   - For initial segmentation: Use "Create" mode
   - For selecting multiple segments: Use "Select" mode
   - For refining segments: Use "Add" or "Remove" modes
4. **Draw the lasso** by clicking and dragging around the desired area
5. **Preview the selection** (if preview mode is enabled)
6. **Confirm or cancel** the operation

## Implementation Notes

### Core Service
- `EnhancedLassoService`: Handles all lasso operations with visual feedback
- Supports different operation modes with appropriate visual styling
- Provides vertex selection and geometry operations

### UI Components
- `TopToolbar`: Enhanced with lasso mode selector and preview controls
- `DentalViewer`: Integrated with enhanced lasso service
- Visual feedback with SVG overlays for real-time lasso drawing

### Future Enhancements
- **Add/Subtract modes**: Complete implementation of vertex addition/removal
- **Brush tool**: Additional selection method for finer control
- **Undo/Redo**: Support for operation history
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Quick mode switching and operation controls
- **Smart selection**: AI-assisted boundary detection

## Technical Details

### Lasso Operation Types
```typescript
type LassoMode = 'create' | 'add' | 'subtract' | 'select'
```

### Operation Results
```typescript
interface LassoOperationResult {
  mode: LassoMode
  selectedVertices: number[]
  targetSegmentId?: string
  affectedSegments: ToothSegment[]
}
```

### Visual Styling
- Dynamic stroke colors and patterns based on mode
- Smooth path interpolation for better visual feedback
- Responsive design that adapts to canvas size

This enhanced lasso tool significantly improves the manual segmentation workflow, providing users with precise control over dental model segmentation while maintaining an intuitive interface.
